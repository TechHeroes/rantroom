The idea is to create a public forum for people to rant about anything under the sun. The forum should allow user registration, login functionality for registered,  email_verified and active users only.
Once logged in users' should be redirected to a profile page based on their username (which is unique). The profile page only consists of dp, short bio and other user information from the database with an option to edit the details.
When user clicks on edit, show a form where user can upload a photo as dp and also edit his information. Email should be non-editable.
